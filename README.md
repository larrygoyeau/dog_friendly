# Mobile app for dog breed image classification

## Introduction

This app uses EfficientNetB3 to classify images of dog according to their breed. This app is an adaptation of the [mlkit](https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit) source code. Front-end was not the main goal of this project in contrary to the machine learning part that can be found in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j76-FNYwVtWzUEYKj7oxBsvxHUJ-pkNA?usp=sharing).
